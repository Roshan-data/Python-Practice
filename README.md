## üéØ Learning Path

The notebooks are arranged to mimic a beginner ‚Üí intermediate Python learning journey:
- Start from **Basics ‚Üí Strings ‚Üí Operators ‚Üí Conditionals ‚Üí Loops**  
- Then practice **Data Structures (List, Tuple, Set, Dictionary)**  
- Move to **File Handling, JSON, OOP**  
- End with **Comprehensions & Lambda**
